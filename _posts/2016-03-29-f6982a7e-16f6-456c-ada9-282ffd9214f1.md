The Vision

Nixor College will change the expectations Pakistan has from its leading educational institutions.

Educational institutions have the responsibility of preparing our youth to make a positive impact on their own future and on that of the groups to which they belong -- be it their families, their friends, or their nation. Clearly, personal academic achievement is of vital importance,  but the ultimate goal in addition to academic accomplishment is grooming Leaders, capable of bringing positive change in society.
